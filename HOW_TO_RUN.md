1. cd into server folder
2. make setup-and-run (this will install dependencies, setup db and then run the server).
3. Optional: Make setupdb, if the db for bug 2 (sqli) breaks. This will make a fresh db and hopefully fixes the issue. Sometimes it "cannot open the db file", just try running it again.
